This program is meant to operate as a selection and management system for designing fireteams within Infinity N5's new
rule system. This is specifically built for JSA's Shidenbutai faction although it can be modified for any
faction or sectorials by changing the troops available.

To operate: Run the Fireteam.py file, the options are:
1. View current teams - This lists how full each team is and what team it is.
2. Add a unit to a team - This is how you add members to each possible fireteam, with options for troop and their profile changing
depending on the fireteam chosen.
3. Remove a unit from the current team - You can do this to remove and therefore replace members of a team.
